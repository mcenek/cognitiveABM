Changing the terrain generated will change the file in TerrainGenerator.cs in "string csvFile"
if you would like to store it in another csv file, change the csvFile to the 
desired filepath. [Important] You have to change terrainFilePaths[2] in Program.cs
for the new file to be used.

* note: in order to see the changes in animate.py you have to also change the the layer[2]
in animate.py to the new filepath.
