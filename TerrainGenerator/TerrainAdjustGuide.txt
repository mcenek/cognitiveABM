To adjust the terrain using different generators, change the desired
createPeaks function in ElevationLandscape.cs to createPeaks and store the
previous one as a different, reasonable, name.

This will change the file in TerrainGenerator.cs in "string csvFile"
if you would like to store it in another csv file, change the csvFile to the 
desired filepath. [Important] You have to change terrainFilePaths[2] in Program.cs
for the new file to be used.

* note: in order to see the changes in animate.py you have to also change the the layer[2]
in animate.py to the new filepath.
